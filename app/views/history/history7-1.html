        <b>Separate parts on the sculpture:</b> There is one very thin slice of wood added to the left side of the chair. Also on the backside, there is a piece of wood added to support the too thinly carved wood.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Missing parts:</b> All the five highest parts of the crown are missing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cracks in timber:</b> There are a few small cracks under the sculpture’s base, which continue to the hollowed back.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Linen or parchment visible:</b> No visible linen. Three pieces of parchment are visible under the gilded garment. On the blue area of the garment there is one large area of parchment visible. On the crown two pieces of parchment are visible. All the parchment has been recycled from an old manuscript; there is writing in German (similar to the writing on the parchment on Christ) on of all of the pieces of parchment. The writing can best be seen in UV light.

    <b>Paint layer</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Light red: Skin and the chair with darker and lighter details and shadowing. Base is almost pink</li>
            <li>Red, red lead: Lips and top of the crown</li>
            <li>Blue, azurite: The lining and collar of the Virgin´s garment</li>
            <li>White: in the eyes</li>
            <li>Black: in the eyes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Silvering:</b> There is silvering on the Virgin´s hair which has been glazed.</p>
    
    <p><b>Hook on the back:</b> There is no hook, but a hole behind the head might indicate that there has previously been one.</p>
    
    <p><b>Other comments:</b> Behind the sculpture, in the neck area there is a hole that continues upwards. This is certainly the hole that was drilled for the peg.</p>
