        <b>Hook on the back:</b> There is an original hook on the back of the sculpture.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Other comments:</b> There is a hole in the chin area created by the hook from the backside of the sculpture. 
        The sculpture has been slightly less hollowed from the back than the other sculptures and is therefore 
        heavier than the other sculptures of the same size.
