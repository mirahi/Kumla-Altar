    <h1>Conservation</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.icom-cc.org/home/">ICOM-CC</a> adopted the following terms: “preventive conservation”, “remedial
        conservation”, and “restoration” which together constitute “conservation” of the tangible cultural heritage. These
        terms are distinguished according to the aims of the measures and actions they encompass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The definitions of the terms are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Conservation</strong> - all measures and actions aimed at safeguarding tangible cultural heritage while ensuring
        its accessibility to present and future generations. Conservation embraces preventive conservation, remedial conservation
        and restoration. All measures and actions should respect the significance and the physical properties of the cultural
        heritage item.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Preventive conservation</strong> - all measures and actions aimed at avoiding and minimizing future deterioration
        or loss. They are carried out within the context or on the surroundings of an item, but more often a group of items,
        whatever their age and condition. These measures and actions are indirect – they do not interfere with the materials
        and structures of the items. They do not modify their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of preventive conservation are appropriate measures and actions for registration, storage, handling, packing and
        transportation, security, environmental management (light, humidity, pollution and pest control), emergency planning,
        education of staff, public awareness, legal compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Remedial conservation</strong> - all actions directly applied to an item or a group of items aimed at arresting
        current damaging processes or reinforcing their structure. These actions are only carried out when the items are
        in such a fragile condition or deteriorating at such a rate, that they could be lost in a relatively short time.
        These actions sometimes modify the appearance of the items.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of remedial conservation are disinfestation of textiles, desalination of ceramics, de- acidification of paper, dehydration
        of wet archaeological materials, stabilization of corroded metals, consolidation of mural paintings, removing weeds
        from mosaics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Restoration</strong> – all actions directly applied to a single and stable item aimed at facilitating its
        appreciation, understanding and use. These actions are only carried out when the item has lost part of its significance
        or function through past alteration or deterioration. They are based on respect for the original material. Most often
        such actions modify the appearance of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of restoration are retouching a painting, reassembling a broken sculpture, reshaping a basket, filling losses on
        a glass vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conservation measures and actions can sometimes serve more than one aim. For instance varnish removal can be both restoration
        and remedial conservation. The application of protective coatings can be both restoration and preventive conservation.
        Reburial of mosaics can be both preventive and remedial conservation.

    <h2>The conservation-restoration of the Kumla altar-piece</h2>

    <p>
        The conservation-restoration of the whole altar was necessary due to the damages mostly to its surface decoration layers.
        It was also covered with a heavy layer of surface dirt and dust.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to archival material, the altar was treated last time in the late 1950-s. The treatment had included wax-resin
        mixture as a consolidant for ground layers, gilding and paint, a tretment commonly used at a time in conservation-restoration
        of painted wood and polychrome sculpture. All the painted surfaces had also been covered with a layer of varnish
        with wax in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        During past 50-60 years new damages had occurred and large areas of ground, gilding and paint were loose and flaking all
        over the altar surface. Most dangerous areas had been protected with glue and thin paper as a surface protection,
        preventing loose areas from complete detachment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Practical conservation on all the surfaces was performed by paintings and furniture conservation students from Finland, Norway
        and Sweden in spring 2015. The conservator Håkan Lindberg from the Swedish History Museum was supervising all the
        work and completed the conservation- restoration project in summer 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conservation-restoration goal was not to restore or repaint, rarely done as a treatment nowadays, but to documenta and
        preserve what was there and to enhance the altars visual integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conservation-restoration treatments included cleaning, wax removal, consolidation of the loose ground, gilding and paint
        layers, varnishing and retouching. The whole project took place in the Swedish History Museum, in the Gothic Hall
        of a new exhibition for Medieval art, open to the public and museum visitors. Over the period of 8 weeks four groups
        of students and their lecturers worked in practical conservation- restoration of the altar and its details in front
        of the eyes of the visitors and gave information on their work and on the altar to those who were interested. (Kuvat
